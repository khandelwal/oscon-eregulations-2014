## Rules

Life is about rules. Every one of you, since the age of two, has been exposed
to rules. I grew up in a reasonably strict household, so there were many rules
I had to follow. 

## Federal regulations are ubiquitous

Regulations exist in many aspects of our lives. Many of you took a commerical
airplane flight this week, to come to Portland and attend this conference. If
you remember, you sat in your own seat (cramped as it was), and were required
to buckle your seat belt during take off and landing. You did not stand, as
some airlines would perhaps like for you to do, as this would allow them to fit
EVEN more people into the back of the plane. 

Sitting in your seat is safe, and putting on your seat belt is safer, and the
airlines (if they want to fly the friendly American skies) are required by
regulation (a rule if you will), to provide you with both.

Title 14 (Aeronautics and Space), part 121 of the Code of Federal Regulations
deals with "Operating Requirements: domestic, flag and supplemental
operations". In particular, paragraph 311 talks about seats and safety belts. 

# Slide 4

This regulation text right here is why you didn't stand on your flight holding
on to a hand rail, on your way here. 

## 37,022

Between fiscal years 2004 and 2013 (an approximately 10 year period), federal
government agencies put out 37,022 final rules. Think of a final rule as a
change to a regulation. 

## REGULATIONS ARE HARD TO READ

Most lawyers, when they read the law, read it in PDFs in this three column
format with a small font size. This is a document that has a well-defined
hierarchy. This hierarchy is not visually represented here. As a person who
programs in Python, the lack of indentation is disturbing.

There is an online version of the Code of Federal Regulations. It's a little
more structured, but it has some of the same problems. The Code of Federal
Regulations is an index of the regulations organized by topic. So, earlier when
we were talking about seat belts in airplanes, that was Title 14 (Aeronautics
and Space). 

Many words in a regulation are specifically defined for the regulation.
However, the defined terms are not called out in the text. The list of words
that are defined is usually housed in one section of a regulation but these
definitions words can also be dispersed throughout. You basically have to
memorize the list of terms that are defined before reading any paragraph. The
definitions are also scoped in the sense they they can be redefined for a
particular section. 

Regulations sometimes have a section at the bottom, that goes over the entire
regulation, explaining the intent of specific sections. This is called
Supplement I. It's really important because it contains the official
interpretation of paragraphs of the regulation. It's meant to be read side by
side with the regulation text. But it's all the way on the bottom. Also,
because it explains the law, it's typically very long. In a particular
regulation I looked at, it was approximately 62.5% of the regulation. But it
doesn't have it's own table of contents to make it easier to only read
particular parts.

## REGULATIONS ARE HARD TO FIND

Final rules are amendments to regulations. These rules are published in the
Federal Register which can be thought of as a journal or blog for the United
States Government. What this means though, is that often we only ever have a
list of changes to a regulation, and not the full compiled version of the
regulation. This makes it hard to see what changes are going to be effective
soon, or even how the regulation evolved. 

## YOU CAN NOT TRAVEL BACK IN TIME

Past versions of a regulation are extremely hard to find. So, if you are
wanting to know what regulation was in effect on a particular date - that's
almost impossible to figure out without a whole lot of manual work.

## Democracy

You as an ordinary citizen can comment on these regulations, and perhaps change
the course of the law. That's a pretty exciting and powerful concept. 

Let's walk through the process of what commenting would be like:

You would first have to read the Federal Register almost daily to be informed
of upcoming changes. There is no topic-based subscription. 

Once you've found the notice, you would then have to read potentially 100s of
pages of text and comprehend all of those words to understand the change being
made. Then you'd go to another rather poorly designed website to comment on the
change. 

You can not select particular paragraphs or sentences you are commenting on.
All you are provided with is one text box to comment on the entire set of
changes. This makes it hard to provide specific, detailed feed back. It also
makes it hard on the person at the receiving end of the comment to interpret
what you're saying. 

Citizen participation is very low, and this is not suprising.
