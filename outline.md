Here is an outline based on the abstract, and @ascott1's comments:

* Brief introduction to talk, and who I am.

# Domain/Subject Matter: An introduction to regulations

* A very broad and high level view of the problem we tried to solve.

* What is a regulation?
    * What do they do?
    * Why we (the public) care about regulations
    * How do they affect your lives?

* A basic introduction to the rule-making process. 

* What are the problems with online regulations?

* Path of a regulation through our system.

    * Parsing, parsing and even more parsing: getting from regulation plaintext
    * to hierarchical actionable data. List open source libraries used for
    * parsing. 

    * Laying infromation on top: definitions, citations and interpretations. 

    * Displaying the regulation.

* A little more detail about the rule-making process, important to highlight the 
parts for diff view. Also, set up for compiling regulations

* Generating redline (diff) views of regulations

* Compiling versions of regulations from descriptions of changes (FR notices):
  how we turn lawyer written statements about changes in regulations into actual actions  (add, delete, move). 

* Tie everything together, and end somehow.
