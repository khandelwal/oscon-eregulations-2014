#Introduction

I'm talking at OSCON 2014 in Portland Oregon. The title of my talk is "Making
Federal Regulations Readable with Python" and is intended to cover some of the
work we did with eRegulations (http://consumerfinance.gov/eregulations). 

Here is the reasonably broad abstract I submitted to OSCON:
http://www.oscon.com/oscon2014/public/schedule/detail/34737. 

If you are unfamiliar with eRegulations, here are some articles:

# RFC and Help

I'm requesting comments on the abstract above, and help with the talk. Here are
some things I'd like input on:

* What should I talk about?
* What aspects of eRegulations interest you the most? 
* What would be of interest to OSCON and the public at large?
* Since this is an Open Source conference, what open source things should I
  talk about?

Basically, I'm asking for your help in crafting this into a talk that's worth
attending!

Please create issues mentioning what you'd like to see!
